Understanding biology, revising what I know

I think it's lame to know about engineering/technology but not have an understanding of biology.
- It's like ignoring a huge database of constructs, structures, algorithms and the fact that they are **real** (and can be built/grown).
- Most of the requirements exist naturally - food, chemicals, processes.
